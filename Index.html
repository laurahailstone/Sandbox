<H3>HTML Elements</H3>
<!--this p tag has inline stylings-->
    <p style="color:blue;">
        An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML document. 
        It's function is to represent the meaning/semantics of the content. Most HTML elements start and end with "tags" <> and  </>. 
        These tags surround and give meaning to the content. For example, this element is a paragraph. It is surrounded by p tags.</p>
    </p>
    <h4>Basic HTML Elements</h4>
    <p>Some tags give a descriptive structure to your HTML which makes it easier to read and
        help with Search Engine Optimization. Some examples include: 
        <ul>
            <li>Headers</li>
            <li>Paragraph</li>
            <li>Image</li>
            <li>Link</li>
            <li>Unordered List (like this one!)</li>
            <li>Ordered Lists</li>
            <li>List Items</li><br>
            <li>Line Break (did you catch that?)</li>
        </ul>
        ...and many more! There are so many elements! Thankfully, elements can 
        be nested within other elements. For example, the "unordered list"
        and "list item" elements have been nested within this paragraph! <br>
        <br>
        There is even a tag which allows you to make comments without them displaying with the rest of your content.
        Look....<!--This comment is NOT visible--> See? No, you can't see it. <!--You can't see this comment--> ...but now you can. 
    </p>
    <h4>HTML5 Elements</h4>
    <p>HTML5 introduces more description HTML tags which makes it easier to read and
        help with Search Engine Optimization. Some examples include: 
        <ul>
            <li>main</li>
            <li>header</li>
            <li>footer</li>
            <li>nav</li>
            <li>video</li>
            <li>article</li>
        </ul>
        Now it can be confusing to know the difference among these structural elements, so here is some help.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Head tag</b>=information ABOUT your page <br>
        <b>Body tag</b> =all the contents of an HTML document, such as text, hyperlinks, images, tables, lists, etc.<br>
        <b>Main tag</b>=main content of the document. Should be unique to the document and not contain any content that is repeated
        across documents such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms.<br>
        <b>Footer tag</b>=usually copyright, authorship, contact information, site map, and links back to the top.

    </p>
    <h4>Images and Links</h4>
    <h4>Web Forms</h4>
    You can make a comment that is not visible.
