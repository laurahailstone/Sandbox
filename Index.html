<!--this p tag has inline stylings-->
    <p style="color:blue;">
        An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML document 
        It's function is to represent the meaning/semantics of the content. Most HTML elements start and end with "tags" <> and  </>. 
        These tags surround and give meaning to the content. For example, this element is a paragraph. It is surrounded by p tags.</p>
    <p>Some tags give a descriptive structure to your HTML which makes it easier to read and
        help with Search Engine Optimization. Some examples include: 
        <ul>
            <li>Headers</li>
            <li>Paragraph</li>
            <li>Image</li>
            <li>Link</li>
            <li>Unordered List (like this one!)</li>
            <li>Ordered Lists</li>
            <li>List Items</li><br>
            <li>Line Break (did you catch that?)</li>
        </ul>
        ...and many more! There are so many elements! Thankfully, elements can 
        be nested within other elements. For example, the "unordered list"
        and "list item" elements have been nested within this paragraph! <br>
        <br>
        There is even a tag which allows you to make comments without them displaying with the rest of your content.
        Look....<!--This comment is NOT visible--> See? No, you can't see it. <!--You can't see this comment--> ...but now you can. 
    </p>
    <h3><center>Structural Elements</center></h3>
    <p>Some HTML elements are used purely for structural purposes.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Div Element</b> - This element defines a section and contains other elements which can then be stylized by CSS or manipulated by JavaScript.</li><br> 
        <li><b>!DOCTYPE... Element</b> - This element tells the browser which version of HTML is being used. Remember that the tag must be capitalized.</li><br>
        <li><b>html Element</b>- This element wraps around all other html elements and acts as a container for the whole document.</li> <br>
    </ul><br>
    <h4><center>HTML5 Elements</center></h4>
    <p>HTML5 introduces more description HTML tags which makes it easier to read and
        help with Search Engine Optimization. Some examples include: 
        <ul>
            <li>main</li>
            <li>header</li>
            <li>footer</li>
            <li>nav</li>
            <li>video</li>
            <li>article</li>
        </ul>
        Now it can be confusing to know the difference among these structural elements, so here is some help.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Head tag</b>=information ABOUT your page <br>
        <b>Body tag</b> =all the contents of an HTML document, such as text, hyperlinks, images, tables, lists, etc.<br>
        <b>Main tag</b>=main content of the document. Should be unique to the document and not contain any content that is repeated
        across documents such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms.<br>
        <b>Footer tag</b>=usually copyright, authorship, contact information, site map, and links back to the top.<br>
      
    <br>
    <h4 style="color:purple;" ><center>HTML Attributes</center></h4>
    <p>
        We can provide more information about HTML elements by assigning them attributes. All HTML elements can have attributes, and 
        the attributes are always specified in the opening tag. For example, the h4 header of this secion has been assigned the
        style attribute of "color:purple;. Here are some other attributes that can be specified:
        <ul>
            <li><b>href=</b> This defines the hyperlink.</li>
            <li><b>src=</b> This is used to embed an image into the code. It specifis the path to the image to be displayed.</li>
            <li><b>height=</b> and <b>width=</b>Used to define the dimensions (in pixels) of an image element.</li> 
            <li><b>alt=</b> This defines defines the alternate text to an image element.</li>
            <li><b>style=</b> This defines the color, font, size, and more.</li>
            <li><b>id=</b> This specifies a unique ID for an html element.</li>
        </ul>
    </p><br>

    <h3><center>Images and Links</center></h3>
    <img src="https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Top-Uses-Of-HTML.jpg" alt="Cool HTML5 Website Image" width="400" height="250">
    <p>You can add images to your website by using the img element, and point to a specific image's URL using the src attribute.
        Remember that the image element is self-closing, which means you don't need /img inside the carrots. Also, every image 
        requires an alt attribute which populates the space with text in the event that the image does not load. Even if the image
        is only for decorative purposes, the alt attribute is required but can be left blank. (ex. alt="")<br>
        <br>
        You can insert a link using text or an image. Here is an example of linking via text. By using an anchor element (a) along with
        a hyperlink attribute (href), followed by the text you want to display in quotes. <a href="https://www.educba.com/uses-of-html/">See here</a>
        The anchor element is not self-closing so the display text is followed by a closing anchor tag.
        </br>
        Now, to get really fancy, we can convert an image into a link by combining these two elements. Check it. </br>
        <a href="https://www.educba.com/uses-of-html/"><img src="https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Top-Uses-Of-HTML.jpg" alt"Cool HTML5 Website" width="400" height="250"></a>
    <!--Make note of the opening and closing <>'s in the image link. These get tricky-->    
    </br>
        What if we want a link to open a new page while keeping the current page up? Well that is done with a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_target.asp" target="_blank">target attribute.</a>
        The value of the target attribute must be set to _blank.
        </br>
        </br>  
        Let's suppose you need to direct a user to another part of your web page. This can easily be done be creating an internal link using an
        anchor element + an href attribute + # symbol + value id. *Be sure to assign the value id to the destination as well.* </br>
        Since this page of notes is getting pretty long, we may need to link to other parts for easier navigation. Let's go back to the 
        <a href="#top-of-page">top of the page.</a>
    </br>
    Finally, let's suppose you want to create an anchor element with a link, but you don't have the destination to assign. You can use the # symbol inside of
    the quotes as a placeholder until you get the correct url. This is called a <a href="#"> dead link</a> because it won't go anywhere, but at least the 
    infrastructure will be in place. (Actually, it seems that the dead link just takes you to the top of the page.)
    </p>
    <h3><center>Web Forms</center></h3>
    <p>
        Sometimes, we need to gather information rather than distribute it. This requires some interactive elements, such as forms.
        On order to use the data that is enetered into a webform, there needs to be specified actions and destinations for the data to go.
        Here is a webform with some input elements with different type= attributes that are used to collect the data.
    </p>
        <form action="url-database-destination">
        <b>Text Field Input Element</b> </br> 
        <i>Please enter an answer in text</i></br>
        <input type="text" placeholder="placeholder attribute"> </br>
        </br>
        <b>Radio Button Input Element</b> (for questions that require only one answer)</br> 
        <i>Please select your favorite input type</i></br>
        <label for="Text Field">
            <input id="Text Field" value="Text Field" type="radio" name="Input Options">Text Field
        </label>
        <label for="Radio Button">
            <input id="Radio Button" value="Radio Button" type="radio" name="Input Options" checked>Radio Button
        </label>
        <label for="Checkbox">
            <input id="Checkbox" value="Checkbox" type="radio" name="Input Options">Checkbox
        </label></br>
        (Notice how the radio button option is checked by default?)</br>
    </br>
        <b>Checkbox Input Element</b> (for questions that can have multiple answers)</br>
        <i>Please select all input types you intend to use for future webforms</i></br>
        <label for="Text Field"></label>
            <input id="Text Field" value="Text Field" type="checkbox" name="Input Use"> Text Field
        </label>
        <label for="Radio Button">
            <input id="Radio Button" value="Radio Button" type="checkbox" name="Input Use"> Radio Button
        </label>
        <label for="Checkbox">
            <input id="Checkbox" value="Checkbox" type="checkbox" name="Input Use"  checked> Checkbox
        </label></br>
        (Notice how the checkbox option has a checked attribute and is the default answer?)</br>
    </br>
        <b>Button Input Element</b></br>
        <i>Please submit your responses to the destination that was specified in the form action above</i></br>
        <button type="submit">Submit Button</button></br>
    </form>
</br>
<h4><center>Value Attribute and Data Collection</center></h4>
<p>
    When a form is submitted, the data is sent to a server and includes the entries
    for the options selected. For radio and checkbox input types, the data 
    that is reported comes from the value attribute.</br>
</br>
    Let's suppose that a user completes the form above, and selects "Radio Button"
    as their favorite input type. Because there is a value attribute assigned
    to the input element, the data "Radio Button" will be reported. If the 
    value attribute is missing, then a default value of "on" will be reported,
    but it is not useful information.</br>
</br>
<u>If you have a webform with radio buttons or checkboxes, ALWAYS REMEMBER TO 
    INCLUDE VALUE ATTRIBUTES!</u>
